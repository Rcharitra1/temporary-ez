### How to edit or create service boundaries for my organisation.
1. Use ![img alt](/img/draw-polygon.png)  to create a **service boundary**. **Draw Polygon** allows you draw straight lines that could be connected together to form a polygon area that best represents the service boundary of your location.
2. Alternatively, the ![img alt](/img/draw-circle.png) **Circle tool** allows you to create a circular boundary for the service area of your organisation. To draw, click and drag a line to increase or decrease the area of the circular service boundary. 
3. The <img src='/img/zoom-in.png' height='40px' width='40px' /> and <img src='/img/zoom-out.png' height='40px' width='40px'/> icons can be used to zoom  in and out of the map.
4. The <img src='/img/move-btn.png' height='40px' width='40px'/>  is used to reposition the created boundary.
5. The <img src='/img/edit-layer.png' height='40px' width='40px'/> is used to snap the resize the created circular or polygon service boundaries.
6. Once finished making changes use the ![img alt](/img/save-btn.png) button to save changes.
